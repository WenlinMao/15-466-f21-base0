How To Play:

Player can control the left paddle. Right paddle will mirror left paddle's behavior. Player initially has 
10 hp and the score will increase every two seconds. Everytime, any of the two balls hit the center wall,
the hp will be deducted. The goal of this game is to survival as long as possible so that your score will be higher.

random changes in speed.
